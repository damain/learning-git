            <h3>What is GIT</h3>
            <p>Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, here is his description of git:</p>

            <blockquote>
                GIT - the stupid content tracker
                <br />
                "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a
                        mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
                    </li>
                    <li>stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.</li>
                    <li>
                        "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills
                        the room.
                    </li>
                    <li>"goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks</li>
                </ul>
                This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory
                contents efficiently.
